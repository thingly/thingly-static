<h2 class="abstract-title content-section">Summary</div>
<p>I’m a leader, mentor, tinkerer, and technologist with 2 decades of
experience in system administration and site reliability engineering. I
tend to think of the Big Picture in terms of systems and tradeoffs, but
I can go deep when/where I need to. The tech itself is almost always the
easy part; it’s the People and Process that are hard.</p>
