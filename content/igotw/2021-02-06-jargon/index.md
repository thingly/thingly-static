[In my 7+ years at LinkedIn I’ve had the opportunity to work with some supremely-talented folks. When I was a member of the growth-sre team Jerrod ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrodlowmaster/) [Lowmaster](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrodlowmaster/) was one such individual. He’s long since moved on to his Next Play, but this dude was (and likely still is) a Data Scientist *par excellence* in all the ways I’ve had the luxury of coming to expect from LinkedIn engineers. Supreme tech chops, driven, deep subject matter knowledge, etc.

He was also an early riser - a relative rarity among Bay-area employees - and...well...duder was Intense.

So. I’d get into the office, grab a cuppa and mebbe a piece of fruit, shuffle on over to my desk and start to get acquainted with my day. It was in this pre- coffee fugue state where Jeh-rode would hit me with both barrels. He’d just stroll up and blindside me with something like “Cliff, I’ve been looking at some data - the ratio of abooks to zeppelins is wonky and I think we should look into it.”

Huh. No shit?

This happened about once a week for months until I finally had to pull him aside for a little chat.

[J-Low. My man. You’re the Godfather of Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown). Your energy, conviction, and delivery have conspired to convince me profoundly that everything you’re saying is right and true and of utmost importance. ...but also, I can only understand about one in three words you’re saying. I need a Jerrod-to-Mere- Mortals translator or a dictionary or...look, maybe we can come up with a more constructive method of triage than you James Browning me and my banana first thing in the morning, mmm?

I think of Jerrod any time I find myself slipping into the _LinkedIn argot_, particularly with newer hires who may not be entirely up-to-speed with the vernacular.
