When I was growing up my dad didn't want my sisters and I to watch [Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) (for reasons I won't get into here). Somehow my mom talked him into watching the episode that aired after Superbowl XXX. [JCVD - then at the height of his fame - was in that episode, and somewhere along the way he ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Van_Damme) uttered the phrase ***"I can crush a walnut with my butt."*** Dad thought that was the funniest thing in the world. He laughed for a solid three minutes, and after that it was okay to watch Friends in his book.

In [*Notes From Underground* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_Underground)[Fyodor Dostoyevsky, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky) wrote ***"...******in spite of all possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth."*** Whatever your opinions of him as a novelist and philosopher-psychologist may be, if you've ever had to undergo emergency dental work you will know this to be true.

[The Simpsons is "the longest-running American" damn-near-everything. Over 32 seasons it's introduced a number of words and phrases into pop culture - ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) "D'oh!", "cromulent", "hidely-ho, neighborino!", and any number of prank call setups. Hell, it's been around long enough that some of these have actually faded away (anyone remember "eat my shorts"?) For my part perhaps my favorite line comes from [Otto the bus driver. Says Otto: ](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Otto_Mann)[***"The call 'em fingers,*** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reruwp_Fs3Y) [***but I never see 'em fing"***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reruwp_Fs3Y), of course following it up with "...oh, there they go."

[Last but not least, one of my favorite work-relevant quotes. I don't know it's origin for certain, but I generally attribute it to David Henke (since he's the first ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drhenke/) one I heard say it). Henke: **"A feature is just a bug in a tuxedo."**

Happy inDay, folks!
