Last weekend I spent 4 days barbecuing. For 3 of them, I was the guy behind the grill (or at the stove). I'm not sure it made me any more proud about being an American - particularly not right now...but I reckon people getting together to eat food in celebration bridges damn near every culture at any point in human history.

I suppose there's a kind of comfort in the pragmatism of the thing. I mean, irrespective of whether or not there's a celebration, one must eat. And I'm the sort of person who will take any excuse to make/share food with friends & family (or even [make up my own).](/igotw/2020-09-04-family-night/)

Anyhow. I've been chewing on (heh) the topic of being the one making the food, specifically, for a while now...and I do suspect I'll be writing about that at some point in the (hopefully near) future.

For now? Enjoy the rest of the shutdown, y'all.
