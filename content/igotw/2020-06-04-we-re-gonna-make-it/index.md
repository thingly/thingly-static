I thought about posting nothing this week. Not my style.

I thought about posting a black square, ala Insta. I have to admit I decided against it because I don't exactly know what it means.

I thought about posting this whole big long thing about how shitty this week has been. It didn't seem necessary. If you're a human being, you already get it.

I thought about posting the song This Year by the Mountain Goats. Right now I'm not sure whether "I'm gonna make it through this year if it kills me" is on point or poignant to the point of being offensive.

I thought about a lot of things.

I hope you're hurting.

I hope you're okay.
