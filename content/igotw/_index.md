Welcome to the igotw archive!

From 2016-2024 I internally published a weekly internal blog at former employer.
It's something I was (and still am) proud of, and I wanted to find some way to
make sure that it wasn't [lost in time like tears in rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80_TbSVBVqA).

So! I've published it here in its entirety.

These posts have all come to exist here in a pretty roundabout sort of way -
exported from Confluence to PDF, extracted to Markdown and PNGs, links munged
around to try and at least maintain consistent linking within the corpus itself,
etc. ...all of which is to say: there are almost certainly broken links, busted
formatting, etc.

While the fidelity may not be great, at least the content is preserved.

Enjoy!
