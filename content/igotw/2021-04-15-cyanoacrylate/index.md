I’m assuming most folks have used superglue before, but for the uninitiated here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Rummage through the junk drawer for the half-tube of superglue you have left over from the last time you used it 6-12 months ago. If you have more than one junk drawer, no sweat - just pick one, then try another. By law, the superglue will *always* be in the second drawer (local statutes may vary).

2. Spend *no fewer* than 15 minutes fiddling with the dried-up superglue trying to get not-dried-up superglue to come out. When the 15 minutes has elapsed, throw it away.

3. Buy new superglue.

4. Open new superglue. *Immediately* discard packaging and/or anything that might claim to provide instructions or safety information.

5. Poke a hole in the place on the new superglue where it seems like the superglue should come out.

6. Carefully squeeze and/or roll the tube until it “spritzes” (you’ll know it when you see it - if you’ve got superglue on *at least* one finger you’ve done it right).

7. Apply superglue to the thing you’re trying to superglue (the *gluee*). The crucial element for success in this step: make sure you either superglue one finger to the gluee and/or superglue one finger to another finger.

8. Replace cap (after locating cap) and toss half-tube of superglue in junk drawer for future use 6-12 months from now. Don’t worry about which drawer (see: Step 1).

9. (Optional) Google “how to get superglue off fingers”, click the first link, and do whatever it says.

10. (Optional) Buy your wife a new pair of sunglasses that don’t have your fingerprint melted into the center of one lens.

For me, superglue falls into the category of things that uniquely provide a necessary function, but that I earnestly hope to never-ever have to use. Post [hole diggers, EpiPens, fire extinguishers...this fuckin’ thing](https://www.amazon.com/Supercrazy-Brake-Piston-Caliper-SF0134/dp/B00L6I16NK).

Anyhow, whilst bathing my fingers in acetone over the weekend I was thinking of things in the World of Computering that fit this category. Tools like *kill stra*, *ce* and *jmap*. Now, each of these have legit (non-emergency) use cases...but I don’t think I’ve ever taken a heap dump because I just love-love-LOVE me , some heap, eh?

What tools in your toolkit are you simultaneously thankful for and hope to never have to use?
