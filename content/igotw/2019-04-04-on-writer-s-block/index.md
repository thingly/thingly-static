I've written plenty. igotw has marched onward once a week for over 3 years. 170 posts by my count (this is the 171st)...and man, this week I'm having a tough time figuring out what to post.

It's not that I don't have inGraphs - I've got a bountiful backlog of screenshots and snapshots. It's not that there's nothing interesting going on - I assure you that there are plenty of interesting things happening, things that I might sort of "report on". ...I just don't know what Story I want to tell this week.

The dedicated reader may have noticed that over the past several months there have been a handful of posts that have nothing at all to do with inGraphs. (heh I've actually gotten a couple of emails along the lines of "Cool, but where are the graphs?") Well...maybe it's time to come clean: if you hadn't noticed already, ***igotw is no longer exclusively about inGraphs****.*

Why? Well...after 3+ years I'm not sure how much more I actually have to say about inGraphs, specifically. I'm certain that there is something that will happen in an inGraph that I haven't seen before. Hell, it's probably happening right now. In that vein I think there will likely *always* be a place for UA posts, how incidents played out in inGraphs, etc. For anyone who has an inGraph they think is fuckin' rad for any reason: ***please, continue to send interesting*** ***inGraphs my way!***

...however.

I want to continue to post weekly, and in order to do that I need this to become something a little different. That's not to say that I won't still post inGraphs - I absolutely will - but it's not *only* going to be about beautiful images that look like dragons (and/or that look like my site falling over.)

I suppose my tl;dr might be something like: Thank you for listening, gentle reader.
