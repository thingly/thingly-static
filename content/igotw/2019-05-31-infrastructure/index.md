Once every few years I get the itch to build a new computer. I don't build with bleeding edge (read: crazy-expensive) parts, but I don't cut corners, either. I do my research to find the knee in the price-performance graph, and that sweet spot is where I spend my money. I went through this hardware refresh exercise a couple of years ago, and the most expensive single component ended up being - no surprise - the graphics card.

About a month ago this machine suddenly shut down and wouldn't boot back up.

I went through your basic "unplug it, wait a little while, plug it back in, press power" exercise a handful of times. No dice. <sigh> Time to rip the lid off and see what's going on.

After a bit of poking about my suspicions were focused on either the power supply or the graphics card. I should mention that I try to optimize for noise level and size in addition to price and performance; I want a machine that is absolutely silent and that has as small a footprint as possible. The latter means that working inside the space constraints of the cases I use can be a real pain. In this particular case, I'd have to take pretty much everything out in order to remove the power supply. Removing the graphics card is a little easier but still fiddly - there isn't enough space for my hand to press the lever on the clip that keeps it in place, so I have to find like a long screwdriver to wedge in there while pulling up and...

Ah! But I could just leave it connected to the motherboard and unplug the power connectors, which are right on top! Easy-peasy! Once I do that I can just fire this thing up, and if it boots then I'll have isolated the problem to the video card and act accordingly. If it doesn't then I know the problem lies elsewhere.

So those are the two scenarios, right? Either I've found the problematic component or I've eliminated it as a suspect.

Allow me to outline a third scenario. A sizzling-crackling sound. Much [Magic Smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke). Shouting and flailing and yanking the power cable out of the back of the box. My entire office smells like an electrical fire. Why does my office smell like an electrical fire? Because I've just caused an electrical fire in my office.

This is a bit of a Don't Be Like Me moment. The card was probably shot to begin with, but I didn't need to set it on fire.

Anyhow, after replacing the graphics card I figured I may as well take the old one apart - why not, right? - and I'm glad I did.

After removing a dozen itty-bitty screws and a bit of yanking, the card was basically comprised of two parts.

The "important bits": a circuit board a few millimeters thick:

The rest of it - the vast majority of the thing, both in terms of volume and weight - was a giant hunk of metal fins and pipes with a few fans strapped onto it:

Huh.

...I needn't have been surprised. It got me thinking about how many other things in the world are like that - things where there is massive infrastructure whose sole purpose is to "wick heat", so to speak. Think of the human body, which is basically a whole bunch of infrastructure whose sole purpose is to support the little chunk of fat on top that does the actual work. Or think about public infrastructure. Water, electricity, miles upon miles upon miles of roads... take a look around, think about all of the things that exist solely so that folks can go about their business without having to go to the well or clear brush [from their path on the way to work. [Side note: The Practical Engineering YouTube channel is a gold mine.] My God, think of the accountants! An entire ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMOqf8ab-42UUQIdVoKwjlQ) profession, millions strong, dedicated just to *counting* things that actually matter. (I say this with great fondness for accountants, I know quite a few of them.)

Remarkable.
