_In honor of Learning inDay (and at the end of ICCDW__, no less) I figured I'd follow the lead of my past self and post a handful of links to some things I've _ found educational.

[First off, we've got this article on Why Do Things Go Right?](https://safetydifferently.com/why-do-things-go-right/) Authored in 2018, this one has been sitting in my igotw "scratch list" of ideas to write about for quite a while now. The gist: things are working the vast majority of the time, so why do we only invest in postmortems/retrospectives for *when things go* *wrong* (which is only 0.01% of the time, if availability numbers are to be believed).

Next is [Lessons Learned From the Migration to Confluent Kafka](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/kafka-migration-lessons-learned), a write-up by an engineer at Honeycomb about a migration that didn't exactly go to plan. The irony of listing this immediately after the previous article is not lost on me...but I mostly just like the nifty radar/spider charts (and in fact, this very article is the reason I know what those kinds of charts are named in the first place).

[Then we've got The Ingenious Design of the Aluminum Beverage Can - a YouTube video about...well...just that. Clocking in at 11:38, I started this video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw) thinking "No way I make it past a minute, minute-thirty tops)...and then proceeded to watch the whole-ass thing twice. The lesson here: the engineering behind everyday items we take for granted is just fucking incredible.

[If you're looking to brush up on your writing skills, this relatively short read on Writing for Engineers has a few good tips and tricks. I don't necessarily agree ](https://www.heinrichhartmann.com/posts/writing/) with everything he says - I think writing is a subjective enough experience that I wouldn't agree with 100% of the advice of *any* author - but the majority of it resonates. A little "trick" I picked up somewhere along the way that aligns with the point on "Make your text skimable": if the thing I'm writing goes beyond a certain number of paragraphs, I'll go back and refactor my writing such that reading  *only* the first sentence of each paragraph should give the reader a reasonably complete and coherent summary version of the text.

[Finally, there's That Annoying Shade of Blue. This one originally caught my eye (](https://bsago.me/posts/that-annoying-shade-of-blue)*see what I did there?*) because the author started off talking about [NetHack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack) , but left me with a better understanding of console colors and the biology of the human eye. I also really like his human-centric framing of what constitutes a "bug" in the context of [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)[ and a11y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility)

Bonus: TIL that the term used for a word abbreviated by replacing letters with the number of letters (as in a11y, k8s, et al) is "[numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym)". My absolute favorite part of that wikipedia article:

*According to Tex Texin, the first numeronym of this kind was "S12n", the electronic mail account name given to Digital Equipment Corporation* *(DEC) employee Jan Scherpenhuizen by a system administrator because his surname was too long to be an account name."*

Happy inDay, folks. Get out there and learn something!
