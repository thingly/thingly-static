Something I hear from time to time: “you don’t post graphs any more”. Well, here’s one:

[blocked URL](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VAKlC02vdxGRXJDtpvnwG3WEgLL6Yx85dClVVovZBODj9N6XboWEujYd7kdq8rQW090XZ9oSZyyjoSMyY8o0hVm9PVB_pneyD8Q_tykqrIr_4NBeJG3CyfA3rSX5R8z-9DdJ3OHx)

It’s a graph of cumulative igotws over time.

I posted a graph something like the above a while back, but _SRE[in]con_ was this week and I’m writing this amongst a pile of folks hanging around at the tail end of the conference so I’m not going to track down the link.

This is the 200th igotw post. Note that it’s not the 200th week that igotw has been posted - I did an extra “bonus” post the week that we were acquired by MSFT. Next week will be the 200th week of the inGraph of the Week. But it’s the 200th post. And that feels like something.

I’ll be back next week with a post that's (hopefully) more interesting than this, but for now...thank you all for tuning in. :-)
