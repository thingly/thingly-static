[Every year on MLK Day I make it a point to watch or listen to the "I Have a Dream](https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety)" speech. Sometimes I'll also listen to one or two of King's other [well-](https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/blog-post/5-martin-luther-king-jr%E2%80%99s-most-memorable-speeches) [known speeches. At the risk of understatement: the man had a gift. Even some 57 years later I suspect I'll be rapidly blinking before he's done speaking.](https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/blog-post/5-martin-luther-king-jr%E2%80%99s-most-memorable-speeches)

When I told my girls we were going to do this on Monday, I got a less-than-enthusiastic response; at their age I reckon having a day off school has more impact than the prospect of watching an old-timey video of "some guy talking". Still...it's important and decidedly still culturally relevant, so we're gonna watch it. Parents have had a long history of boring their children, who am I to mess with tradition?

Also, a friend recommended "[Our Friend, Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Friend,_Martin)", which we'll (re-)watch this year, likely with better results in terms of attention spans.
