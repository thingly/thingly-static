[I recently stumbled upon this collection of postmortems on Github. It's a treasure trove exploring interesting incidents across a bunch of different domains - ](https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems) not just tech! For instance:

[*Sweden. Use of different rulers by builders caused the*](https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-02-23/new-clues-emerge-centuries-old-swedish-shipwreck) *Vasa* *to be more heavily built on its port side and the ship's designer, not having built a* *ship with two gun decks before, overbuilt the upper decks, leading to a design that was top heavy. Twenty minutes into its maiden voyage in* *1628, the ship heeled to port and sank.*

Oof. I guess differently-sized rulers was the 17th-century equivalent of a missing comma.

It also references a somewhat-infamous [Steam bug from 2015, in which Steam would delete all user data after being moved to a different directory. My ](https://hackaday.com/2024/01/20/how-a-steam-bug-once-deleted-all-of-someones-user-data/) absolute favorite part about this one is the developer put the comment # Scary! directly above the offending line of code. Classic!

Anyhow, if you're into this sort of thing this is enough of a rabbit-hole to keep you busy for quite a while. You've been warned.
