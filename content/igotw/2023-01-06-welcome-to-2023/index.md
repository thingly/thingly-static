Last year my wife committed to regularly doing yoga. She signed up some time in the spring (maybe April-ish?) and started doing a few classes a week. She got into a regular routine/rhythm and really stuck with it. Last month her FitBit spat out an end-of-year report revealing that she'd attended something on the order of 120 classes in 2022.

Most impressive!

...and then January came along, with its usual bevy of New Years' Resolutionistas. Now, if you are the owner of a yoga studio or a gym then I assume that this is your Black Friday equivalent. But if you're a *member*? Scheduling is a nightmare, sessions are at capacity/overbooked, studio spaces are [overflowing with crusty jugglers. Oof.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1aBUN8qELA)

Ah, well. Given what I've come to know about the efficacy of both gym memberships and resolutions, I suspect it'll settle back down within a month or so.

At any rate - Happy New Year, folks!
