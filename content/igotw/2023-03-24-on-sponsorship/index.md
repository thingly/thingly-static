Last October I gave a _SiteCon 2022 talk on _[Being Staff](https://linkedin.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c71e0057-d402-41cf-ab8b-af3c011e8631). The talk covered some of the mechanics of the promotion process, but it was largely in the space of what being a staff engineer   - what it means, what it looks like on a day-to-day basis. More recently, *is*_Brian Wilcox_ hit me with this guide about "[What do ](https://staffeng.com/guides/what-do-staff-engineers-actually-do/?ref=blog.relyabilit.ie) [Staff engineers actually do?"...and I was frankly blown away by how much it resonated. It's the type of thing I read while mumbling "true, true" to myself ](https://staffeng.com/guides/what-do-staff-engineers-actually-do/?ref=blog.relyabilit.ie) after every other paragraph.

Experiential validation aside - *"Huh...maybe I'm* not *Doing It Wrong..."* - the section on mentorship and sponsorship caught my eye. I've covered _mentorship_ [here before, but the term "sponsorship" was novel to me. The linked blog post about "What does sponsorship look like?" was particularly illuminating in ](https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/) terms of differentiating between the two. My "light bulb" moment happened around this bit:

*To sponsor someone is to feel on the hook to help get someone promoted. It is raising up the name of someone to help them get* *more opportunities to do visible, valuable work. It is* not *just giving advice and mentorship. Often, you can sponsor someone without* *them even knowing it (many of the people I sponsor have no idea I consider them sponsees).*

Reading this was a bit like learning what the word "emulsion" means after having been a mayonnaise-maker  for years. **Holy crap, I've done this - I just* *didn't know it was called that!*

Anyhow, many thanks to bwilcox for the pointers, and if this is the sort of thing that interests you I'd highly recommend both linked posts.
