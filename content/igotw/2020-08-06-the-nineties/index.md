[I stumbled across a thing on the Interwebitubes last week - an attempt to define “the ‘90s music canon” by mining some data to figure out which hit songs ](https://pudding.cool/2020/07/song-decay/) from the ‘90s are standing the test of time and which are fading into obscurity. Having been a teenager for most of that decade this had me feelin’ emotions (heh - see what I did there?):

**Joy**: *Oh man, I haven’t heard this tune in a* minute*! Imma go listen to it right now.* **Melancholy**: *Aww, it’s Whitney.* **Disgust**: *Ah. It’s the Macarena.* **Perplexity**: *Okay, this list is super pop-y so I can understand the lack of any kind of rock or grunge influence, but like...no Counting Crows in* *here?* **Anger**: *...and seriously, where the fuck is Hootie?* **Acceptance**: (after a bit more research)[ *Ah, okay, so the Billboard Hot 100 just sucks. So be it.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Billboard_Hot_100_number-one_singles_of_the_1990s)

After at least an hour of scrolling through the infographics I had to get off of this data-fueled emotional rollercoaster. I’d never heard of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) before seeing this post, but I feel a little like I was ambushed - like they took a Venn diagram of things I care about, found a good intersection point, and said “Coolcoolcool, so let’s do a data-viz post about 90s music and frame it in the context of people Cliff’s age vs. people Cliff’s little sister’s age. That should get ‘im.”

Anyhow, one last interesting tidbit: there are a handful of songs for which the recognition factor is actually *higher* among the younger generation:

So I guess as a parting thought: *Who on Earth is Glenn Medeiros?*
