I've been avoiding posting about COVID-19 - I thought maybe igotw could be about Something Else. As it turns out, posting about anything else this week is simply impossible. And it's my wife's fault.

Let me explain.

Kate and I played (virtual) cards with some friends tonight. Afterward, she and I talked a bit about what this week's igotw might be about. I jotted down some notes, and the shortlist looks something like:

Proliferation of delivery services/businesses trying to find ways to stay afloat The kids are at home ALL THE TIME...how do we make this a positive experience for them? When might restaurants re-open? (And when will we feel comfortable actually going to them, irrespective of when they decide to re-open?) Etsy stock is up! (shameless plug: [Kate's Etsy store)](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThirtyOak)

In short, the conversation was dominated by the current weirdness of the world.

...and that's okay.

In the future we'll talk about this as "zeitgeist". In the present it's a crushing, overbearing, and ever-present weight on everyone's mind.

...and that's okay.

I mean, it fucking sucks.

...but it's okay.

Please, be kind to yourself. Be kind to others. Lit'rally Everyone is "going through some shit" right now.

It's going to be okay.
