Due to a bit of a home re-org I'm displaced this week - which is to say, sans office (I'm writing this at my dining room table). So...opportunity to unload (unleash?) a few bits 'n' bobs from my inGraph backlog. Let's see what we've got.

First up - in rapid succession, a few examples of the _Moiré Effect__ that were sent my way by John Wingenbach__ and Mykyta Gubenko :_

All blue. Huh. I'm going to have to start playing around and finding other colors.

Anyhow, this next one I think came from some recent GCN or other but I'm too lazy - and my lower back hurts too much from sitting on this damnable dining chair all week - to go figure out which one:

Happy Friday, folks!
