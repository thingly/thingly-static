A recent update on my phone put me in mind of this xkcd about experts in a given field misjudging non-experts' understanding of topics in that field:

The update is pretty straightforward: my phone asked "Would you like me to automatically clean up [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password)s after 24 hours?"

I had a bit of a chuckle thinking about the reaction that *most* people would likely have to this question. Now, maybe The Goog is trying to uplevel folks' understanding of infosec terminology by injecting it into their products. ...but I think a more likely scenario is that some techno-dweeb implemented this feature in the absence of a product person saying "Y'know, we should really call them 'security codes' or 'PINs' - something Mere Mortals are familiar with." By virtue of being decidedly a member of the techno-dweeb set   happen to know what an OTP is...but I'm imagining a phone call from my father-in-law: *I* "Cliff...what in hell is an OTP? Do I have one? Do I need to clean it up?"

This got me thinking about masters of craft in other areas. Like [Jacques Pépin making a French omelette. It's just that simple, eh? Or ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wb5Crj917I)[this guy teaching ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8clAqfrk-pk) [how to make baguettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8clAqfrk-pk). (The thing that blows my mind about the latter: Duder is wearing a black cable-knit turtleneck, winging flour around with wild abandon, and has not one spec of white anywhere on him.)

[Or from the world of sports: Ted Williams' batting advice. This actually starts off pretty reasonably - "You've got to wait for the right pitch" - but then he ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOohZcPuvdg) follows it up with (paraphrasing) "...and if you *don't* [get the right pitch, crush a dinger anyway." <sigh> Pretty sage there, Teddy. Even more hilariously, Bea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8Rh6KuuH6w&t=22s) [st Mode's rushing "technique". Awesome.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8Rh6KuuH6w&t=22s)
