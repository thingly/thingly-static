Several months ago we made plans to go to brunch with some of my wife's old college buddies. We met at what can only be described as a "kid-friendly dive bar" (don't look at me that way, some of you know exactly the kind of place I'm talking about). It was a lovely establishment - one might go so far as to call it "charming" - with a great brunch menu, friendly staff, and...a bloody mary bar.

The bloody mary is my go-to brunch beverage, and I suppose I can understand the appeal of having a table full of different spices and hot sauces and charcuterie to apply to building one's own magnificent cocktail creation. ...but the bloody mary bar is not for me for a variety of reasons, not least of which [is the paradox of choice.](/igotw/2021-08-12-on-curation/)

So when it came time to order our drinks, I asked our waiter "I'd like a bloody mary, please, but I'd like you to make it for me." Not him, personally, you understand, but the trained professional getting paid to make drinks. Or Ol' Margie Behind-the-Bar. Whoever they've got on hand that knows how to make the thing, who will undoubtedly do it better than I can.

He laughed and said "There are placards that tell you what everything is - don't worry, we'll help you if you get confused."

Now, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt - he probably wasn't laughing *at* me, perhaps he genuinely thought I was making a joke. Also, I was a waiter/bartender for several years and I would never *ever* mistreat the waitstaff. They'd have to do something pretty egregious - smack my grandma and I'm probably still leaving 20% - but it was at this point that my wife gave me a Look. After nearly 17 years of marriage she's got a pretty good grasp on when I'm about to open my mouth, and this Look said "Cliff, do *not* open your mouth. Make your drink, eat your omelet...you can say whatever you're thinking right now in the car ride on the way home."

...but I mean, what's next? Where is this headed? I order food and they point me in the direction of a pile of ingredients and a grill? With placards "in case I get confused"?

Oh, wait, [that's a thing.](https://www.gomongo.com/)

So.

I made my drink.

I ate my omelet.

We had a lovely time, and when the time came to order Round Two...I got a beer.

Thankfully they didn't make me brew the fucking thing myself.
