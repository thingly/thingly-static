Last weekend I asked my brother-in-law if he could swing by for a bit Sunday morning before the Browns game to give me a hand moving some furniture around. He couldn't make it - he had plans to take his mom to brunch - but he told me he had some free time Thursday morning.

"Thursday" meaning today.

Thanksgiving Day.

...and he's hosting.

Signals get lost in SMS, so I don't know if he was joking ("haha I'm free on Thursday"), or trolling me ("screw you and your couch, bro"), or genuinely gung- ho about screaming over here for an hour while the turkey was cooking and then rushing on back home to finish out watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and getting the rest of the food ready. Maybe he just plain forgot that "next Thursday" was Thanksgiving?

I suppose I'll have to ask him about it in a couple of hours when we show up at my sister's place. My furniture remains unmoved, but so long as there's _food and beer and football I'm not gonna sweat it. ...and after last year's shit-show of a Thanksgiving_, if there's *not* food and beer and football then so help me God...

Anyhow.

Happy Thanksgiving, folks.
