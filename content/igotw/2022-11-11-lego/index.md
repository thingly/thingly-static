I've been reading a book about toy history to my youngest at bedtime, and a recent chapter focused on the history of Lego. One of the factoids at the end of the chapter: Lego claims that only 26 out of every 1,000,000 Lego bricks produced is considered defective. A little poking around online for other interesting Lego facts revealed that number to be reported at something more like 18 out of every 1,000,000. So a 99.9974% - 99.9982% success rate. Most impressive.

A former colleague pointed out "well, maybe Lego's quality control just sucks and they're shipping shit bricks." This is a fair point. It's also worth noting that this is self-reported, so maybe they're fudging the numbers a bit (although it's not obvious to me why a privately-held company would do this).

However, I think there are a few pretty decent counterpoints:

1. This is decidedly anecdotal, but I don't think I've ever seen a janked Lego brick that hadn't become janked by a kid after-the-fact.

[2.  Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego) has been producing these bricks for over 70 years, so I reckon they've had significant time (and incentive - defective product costs real money) to improve their manufacturing processes.

3. [Perhaps most-crucially: Lego has shipped over 600 billion parts over the course of a 70+ year journey to becoming one of the top toy companies ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241241/revenue-of-major-toy-companies-worldwide/) [in the world, producing one of the ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241241/revenue-of-major-toy-companies-worldwide/)[most beloved toys of all time.](https://nostalgiacentral.com/blog/top-50-greatest-toys-of-all-time/)

Given that last point, I'd go so far as to characterize Lego's QC as "Decidedly Good Enough", irrespective of what their *actual* defect rate is. Good on you, Lego!
