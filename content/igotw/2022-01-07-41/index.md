I have an early January birthday (yesterday, in fact). Birthdays and New Years are typically times for reflection/introspection, so one might think I've been just reflecting and introspecting my ass off all week. However, I also took the week after the company shutdown off (this week). Beyond "huh, my age is a prime number again" about the only reflection I've done is deciding when (and whether!) I might consider changing out of my sweatpants in the morning.

To my credit: I've put on real pants every day this week. Because I'm an adult...but also, because we haven't had the good sense to stay in the house.

Anyhow, I reckon I've got all weekend to reflect.

...or maybe it can wait 'till next week.

Stay warm out there, folks!
