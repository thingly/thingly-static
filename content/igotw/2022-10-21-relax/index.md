_SiteCon22 was this week. It'_s easily my favorite work event of the year, and serves as an annual reminder why I'm proud to work for LinkedIn. (Yes, I am directly plagiarizing my feed post about it.) I consider myself to be an extrovert, thriving off of interaction with other humans - which conferences in general (and SiteCon, in particular) provide in spades, even in spite of being fully virtual for the last couple of years.

That said, after 3 days with my mouth affixed to a fire hydrant of culture and technical topics I find myself needing to unwind. Luckily, I recently stumbled [across this YouTube channel of Japanese restaurant kitchens making and serving noodles. It's just a bunch of 30-ish minute videos of folks cooking and ](https://boingboing.net/2022/10/14/a-youtube-channel-of-japanese-restaurant-videos.html) serving noodles...and it might be the most relaxing damn thing I can imagine.

Enjoy!
