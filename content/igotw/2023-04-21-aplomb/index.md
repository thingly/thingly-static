In addition to sporting the most impressive unibrow since [Bert ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_(Sesame_Street))[Paul Vixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie), [ has a pretty incredible tech résumé. So much so that he was inducted into the ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Vixie)[Int](https://www.internethalloffame.org/2015/02/03/paul-vixie-internet-sheriff/) [ernet Hall of Fame in 2014. A good deal of his body of work has been in the space of security, as his IHoF nickname "Internet Sheriff" would seem to ](https://www.internethalloffame.org/2015/02/03/paul-vixie-internet-sheriff/) indicate.

...but I think my favorite of his contributions is [this single email.](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/ch3dM6_y2FSBVnSfwvA09nnVXIo/)

It is in reply to some punk asking a deliberately incendiary question, just dripping with snark: *Was DNS intentionally designed to be insecure?*

Now, Vixie could've gone all [Hub McCann on him - he's decidedly got the cred to do so - but he didn't. He took the high road and responded with utmost ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FAdEzhorq4&t=30s) grace and gravitas. There is zero fat on his reply; every sentence carries weight and most are utterly quotable on their own.

*The world of the internet in 2019 would have been seen as a total freak show by the community who deployed dns in the 1980's.*

*Nothing that can be abused won't be.*

*Putting the full spectrum of human culture atop a technology platform designed for academic and professional culture should have* *been understood to be a recipe for disaster.*

Good on you, Mr. Vixie. That last one in particular gives me chills, and is a helpful reminder when I'm mad at computers for computering that the problem *m* *ay* not have been the computers in the first place. Perhaps it was the Human Beings all along.
