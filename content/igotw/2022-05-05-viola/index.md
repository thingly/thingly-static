Last night my oldest daughter had her spring strings concert.

The mechanics: in the fourth grade you can opt into a strings instrument (violin, viola, cello, or bass). In the fifth grade, you can either choose to stick with strings, OR you can opt to play a different instrument in the sort of "not-strings" band (woodwinds, horns, percussion, etc.)

My oldest is in the fourth grade, and this year she decided to try the viola.

The concert itself went about as expected - lots of Old MacDonald and Frère Jacques. But I thought their music teachers' commentary on the fifth graders is worth noting.

This concert was the fifth grade class' first time performing live. ...but also, this year was the first time they had the opportunity to both meet their instructor *and* play together as a group in-person. Last year, the entirety of their instruction and practice occurred via video conference.

I want you to think about that a bit - I mean, really think about it. Imagine it's 2020/2021, and you're trying to teach some 4-dozen 9-year-olds - who have never picked up an instrument in their life! - how to play...on Zoom.

Now, fast-forward the beginning of this year. Students are returning to school, with social-distancing and masking policies in place. Imagine trying to teach a 10-year-old - who has never picked up this instrument in their life! - proper embouchure, when you both have to wear a mask and you can't get within 6 feet of them. (For those who have never played an instrument: embouchure is fundamentally how you put your mouth on the thing - how you hold your lips, your tongue, your teeth, your cheeks. Yes, there is absolutely a Right Way and a Wrong Way.)

Holy crap.

The fifth grade band has significantly fewer players than fourth grade strings - both by virtue of attrition after the first year, as well as being split between the "band" and those who want to continue on with strings. In the "band", there was one - ONE - little girl on the flute.

And she had a solo.

And she crushed it.

So far as I'm concerned, Mr. Damicone is a fucking Hero.
