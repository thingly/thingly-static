_It's Play inDay, so I thought I might pass along this _[list of programming playgrounds](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/04/17/a-list-of-programming-playgrounds/) I happened across recently. Some of them you may already be familiar with (e.g., [JSFiddle), but for me a lot of these playgrounds were novel. I'm particularly impressed with the ](https://jsfiddle.net/)[compiler explorer, and ](https://godbolt.org/)[crontab guru had me ](https://crontab.guru/) [shouting "My God, where was this 15 years ago? I could've really used this!" I think the next one I'm going to dive into is Oh My Git ](https://ohmygit.org/)[xkcd 1597](https://xkcd.com/1597/)[ (](https://ohmygit.org/) is a little too real for comfort).

Happy playing!
