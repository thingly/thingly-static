[Seth Godin is next week's Speaker Series speaker!](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EmployeeExperienceEvents/SitePages/SpeakerSeries.aspx?CT=1610383410847&OR=OWA-NT&CID=ba611e99-8e57-396a-b640-9aa92791338f#upcoming-event) He'll be talking about [The Carbon Almanac](https://thecarbonalmanac.org/) - an effort to educate and drive action on climate change. I have to admit that I haven't read the book...but also TIL: you can order a free copy of the book [here](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EmployeeExperienceEvents/SitePages/Free-Books.aspx). (I just ordered mine.)

Seems like a reasonably good way to spend 45 minutes on a Learning inDay.
