This week's post is a bit of a milestone: by my count it is the 365th igotw. If you were a new hire and you wanted to catch up, at a rate of one post per day it would take you an entire year to read through the entire "backlog". ...and by that time there would be 52 new posts awaiting you.

For the pedants among us saying "Well, what if it were a leap year?", (1) it's not, but also (2) I'll solve for that next week.

[A recent brief piece entitled "You should write more](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/you-should-write-more)" kind of sums up my take on things - why write, why *continue* to write, etc. In particular, I love his response to the idea that "your article doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before" - not because I have "online critics" to speak of, but because I often think this to myself *about* myself. ([Impostor Syndrome is a real thing, folks.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

To wit: painters are still "allowed" to paint landscapes, singers are are still "allowed" to sing love songs.

I think that's just lovely.
