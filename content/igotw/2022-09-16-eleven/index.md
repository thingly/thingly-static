[Sometimes I stumble across answers to questions I didn't know I had. This blog post about why speedometers have speeds going up to 160MPH is a ](https://boingboing.net/2022/09/12/heres-why-your-cars-speedometer-goes-to-160-mph-even-though-that-will-never-happen.html) recent example. The majority of folks don't have vehicles capable of achieving anywhere near that speed, and even if they do they're unlikely to ever actually drive that fast (sorry, [Sinclair). ...so why have an instrument with a top-end measurement that's so far outside of likely - or even ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious)*possible* - operating parameters? *(Quick side note: Yes, I fully recognize that Teslas are all the rage and that BMWs are the sort of "Honda Civics of the Bay Area"...* *but I'm talking about actual cars that real people own in the Real World, folks, so bear with me here...)*

For those too lazy to click through the tl;dr is - in a word - aesthetics. "[These go to 160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o)" is a design decision that ensures that speeds within the range of the typical operating speed of the car are in the easiest place to read: at the top.

Huh. Nifty.

This got me searching for other similar examples. Thermostats might be the closest thing I can think of. A typical thermostat has a range from 50F to 90F. Those temperatures are respectively colder/hotter than you're likely to want to keep your home, but using these bookend temperatures places the common operating range (within a few degrees of 70) at the top.

I also went back through some old igotws looking for _this lil guy_ - an example of changing the upper/lower bound "bookends" in order to remove UX occlusion of the interesting data points.

It's actually easier for me to think of counterexamples - places where this design approach *doesn't* work or is actively detrimental to the user experience. Like...think about fuel gauges. Suppose instead of being on a continuous scale from Empty to Full they went from 0 to 100 gallons. (Your gas tank likely holds something on the order of 15-16 gallons.) How furious would you be if every time you filled up your tank the gauge told you that you were at "16%"?

Anyhow. Happy Learning inDay, folks!
