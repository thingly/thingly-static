Today is Gratitude inDay, so I’ve spent a little time thinking about the things I’m grateful for. The top of that list is pretty standard: Family & Friends - the people who are there for me, who I can depend on, who I try desperately not to take for granted and [celebrate whenever I can. Expanding a little way ](/igotw/2020-09-04-family-night/) beyond that in the category of People, I’m grateful for anyone who’s ever taken a chance on me, gone to bat on my behalf, given me the benefit of the doubt, or cut me a little slack when I fucked up. If I really think about it, I’m also grateful for the less-dependable friends I’ve had over the years. I suspect most people have at least one friend who comes to mind here - the one who is the most fun (***if*** they show up). The world needs flakes, too.

In the category of Prosperity I’m grateful for being gainfully employed doing interesting work with a purpose I believe in, but I also think back on all the crappy jobs I’ve had with a certain fondness. I spent a summer working at a Dairy Queen, I sold footwear at a sporting goods chain, I was a waiter /bartender in a steakhouse for a few years. These were all experiences that shaped who I am today. I have a buddy (who also did a stint as a waiter) who firmly believes that everyone should be required to spend at least one year working customer service as a character- and compassion-building exercise. I tend to agree with him.

I’m grateful for the pig. If we’ve ever had a conversation about food you’ve probably heard me say that if I had to pick one animal that was the only animal that I could eat for the rest of my life, it would be the pig. Ham. Bacon. Ribs. Sausages, pulled pork...oh man, carnitas! I also love beef and chicken and seafood...but the pig? You can take any part of this animal and make something delicious out of it. It’s incredible.

_I’m grateful to live in an age of Modern Miracles. The microwave. The internal combustion engine. Indoor electricity, forced-air HVAC, and plumbing. (I _ enjoy camping, but anyone who tells you they prefer pooping outside out of necessity and not by choice is insane.)

[I’m grateful for cd92.9 (nee cd102.5, nee cd101) - a fundamental part of the Columbus local music community, hands-down my favorite alternative radio ](https://cd1025.com/) station, and one that I’ve been listening to for the better part of 25 years now.

I’m grateful for Me - for existence, for conscious thought and human experience. *Cogito ergo* gratus *sum*, eh?

What are you grateful for?
