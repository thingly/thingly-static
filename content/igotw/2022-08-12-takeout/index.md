I love to cook, but we also like to go out to eat. Unfortunately Covid-19 put the kibosh on that until relatively recently, so we turned to DoorDash. In fact, we started ordering so much that it actually made financial sense for us to subscribe to DashPass. If you order so much takeout that a $10 monthly subscription actually *saves* you money on it...well...you may just order too much takeout.

Worse, I actually had a DoorDash rep reach out to me directly. See, when we order, I'll typically start up a group order and send a link to my wife - largely due to laziness convenience; we can both order simultaneously without having to either pass a device back-and-forth or someone having to be "secretary". As it turns out this pattern caught the attention of one DoorDash corporate account executive. Her email:

*Around the world, companies are changing the way they operate during this time of uncertainty - DoorDash included.*

*We’re getting an influx of requests from companies asking how they can help their employees while they transition to working from* *home. That’s why I’m reaching out to you.  We noticed you’ve placed group orders on DoorDash recently and, we’re curious, are* *you ordering for a business?*

*If so, I’d love to help you during these uncertain times. We have an array of solutions for corporate orders both in and outside of the* *office, many of which can come at no cost to you. If you’d like to learn more, I’m providing direct access to my calendar here. [*link omitted]

I think it's awesome that they were trying to do something to help out in time of need. ...but also...if we're ordering so much that they think we must be ordering for a business? Maybe we should cook a little more often...
