My sister pointed out how life is a bit like [The Truman Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/) right now. It’s not exactly [Groundhog Day](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/)[ - notably, there’s no Ned Ryerson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTVuSVG9DKA) - but there is [admittedly a certain kind of quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXqblYbUAeI) that might make someone who has seen the movie wonder “Am I on TV right now?”

Stuck in a “protective bubble”? Check. Monotony of everyday life? Check. Carefully-constructed set of global circumstances, travel restrictions, and personal phobias that prevent one from going to Fiji? Check, check, and check.

Huh.

I don’t want to delve too deeply into this - I don’t think anyone is actually being unwittingly being filmed for a reality show - except to point out a couple of things:

1. Truman actually lived a pretty good life while he was on the show, and

2. Truman eventually got out.

Maybe we can pick up the Utopia vs. Dystopia argument after the break...or after a few months...or after life returns to whatever the “new normal” ends up looking like. For now I’ll just leave you with this:

...in case I don’t see ya: good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
