[I recently came across a post](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/how-raspberry-pis-are-made-factory-tour)[ by Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/) (and an associated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2C4lbbIH0c)) about how Raspberry Pis are manufactured. I was skimming through the post - mostly looking at the pictures, if we're being honest - when this one stood out:

[It caught my eye because I have a buddy who used to work at ABB](https://global.abb/) - the company who makes these badboys (in case the big bold red letters didn't make that clear).

[He let me know that this particular robot is called a YuMi](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robots/collaborative-robots/yumi/irb-14000-yumi), and it is a "collaborative robot". What does that mean? Well, it means that human beings actually [train these things. There a great example of this in the video around the 4:05 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2C4lbbIH0c&t=245s), in which the robot places a component using a peculiar little wiggle /rocking motion. Why did the robot do it that particular way and not some other? Well, because that's how humans used to do it.

The video made me feel a bit like a kid again, watching a Mr. Rogers video about "how pencils are made" or suchlike. They walk through the making of a Pi step-by-step, talking about refinement of process, testing strategies for the boards...and how Raspberry Pis themselves are actually being used in a dozen or more places *as a part of the manufacturing process.* As Geerling puts it "Pis making pis." Neat!

Super-interesting stuff (if you're into that kind of thing), and I'd recommend checking it out when you have 15 minutes.
