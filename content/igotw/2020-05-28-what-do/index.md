I took a walk around my block tonight. By myself, after the kids were in bed. Not a long walk - just the "short block". I've seen this neighborhood in the daytime a jillion times, I'd never quite seen it in this way.

It's a lovely night. Shorts-and-a-t-shirt weather (for a typically jeans-and-a-fleece kinda guy). We've had some rain, so greenery is lush. Also, I live in the Midwest so things are mowed, things are trimmed.

No earbuds. There was friendly chatter here and there on porches. Nice.

The porches shone, in just such a way.

There was also a group of 20 or so dickhead kids on bicycles making noise on the far corner of the block. heh - a Biker Gang, yeah?

I called my mom halfway through the walk. Because I felt like I oughta call my mom. (It was the right call.)

Go on. Go take a walk.
