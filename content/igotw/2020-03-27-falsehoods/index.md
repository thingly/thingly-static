[Way back in 2010, a guy named Patrick wrote a post about Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names. I ](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/)*believe* it may have been the first of its kind, and led to many subsequent authors coming up with similar "Falsehoods..." on all different kinds of topics. Somewhere along the way, [Awesome Falsehood](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) was created - *"**A curated list of falsehoods programmers believe* in." Per the site:

"...*Falsehood* articles are a suite of wordy unit-tests covering extensive edge-cases provided by real-world usage."

You may be poking through these articles and thinking "Wouldn't it be cool if we had one of these for LinkedIn things?" Well, gentle reader, look no further:

[Falsehoods Engineers Believe About Availability At LinkedIn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXIWOTewxXXsOHfM9ouBQX27CuGfMf6ZkSWVz9APxGs/edit)

_Conceived and primarily authored by Brian Thomas_(with a handful of contributions from other folks), this is a pretty good list of the kinds of things you should be aware of if you touch LinkedIn services as a part of your day-to-day. ...or even if you don't "touch" them directly but care about them working, generally.

Putting on my SRE hat (hmm...did I ever really take it off?) I think it's also interesting to view this as being prescriptive of things we could be doing better - a todo list of items that would make our site more reliable (and our lives better) if we started crossing some of them off.
