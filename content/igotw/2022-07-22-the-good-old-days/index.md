If you're over a certain age, you may remember a time when you could go buy a Thing - a television, a video game, a toaster, a doorbell, a smoke detector, or what-have-you - and when you got home the steps required were:

1. Plug it in (or put batteries in it).

2. Turn it on.

3. Use it.

Well, gentle reader, I'm afraid those days are long gone. Steps #1 and #2 still generally hold...but man oh man, is there ever a whole lot of fuss before getting to #3 these days. You gotta connect it to the wifi, accept the EULAs, download the updates, install the app on your phone, connect your account (or perhaps accounts, plural)...

I helped my mother set up a new TV this morning. Her Samsung password is 27 characters long...and *of course* I typed a 'q' instead of a 'g'. And *of course* i t deleted all trace of what I'd entered the first time so that I'd have the exciting opportunity of having to give it another go from scratch. It was a kind of sadistic carnival game: "Oooh! D'ya think I'll get it this time, mom?" ...and then we had to do Hulu. Disney+. Amazon Prime. "The Netflick".

Fuck me, who would've thought that making a $400 electronics purchase decision with a retiree holding the pursestrings would be the *easy* part of the whole ordeal?

...and God help you if parental controls are involved. Trying to get Minecraft working for two children who want to play a LAN game together could be the subject of a whole other post. The tl;dr is that while the idea of parental controls seems good on its face - We *must* Protect The Children! - in practice they're really just a roadblock to getting anything to actually work (short of disabling them outright).

<sigh> Anyhow. I'm just blowing off some steam, in a decidedly "Get Off My Lawn" fashion.

Happy Friday, folks. And Happy inDay!
