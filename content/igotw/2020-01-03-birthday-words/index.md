[I have a birthday coming up and it got me thinking about a post](https://boingboing.net/2019/10/16/fun-interactive-way-to-see-wha.html)[ I saw a while back about Merriam-Webster's "Time Traveller". The site lets you pick a year ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/time-traveler/) and take a peek at the (English) words that were first used in print in that year. Pretty nifty! A few gems from [my birth year](https://www.merriam-webster.com/time-traveler/1981) include: *boom box, camcorder,* *LAN, snowboard,* and *sysop.* I like to compare that to much more-recent words - like *blockchain* (2011), or 2014's *manspreading.* Unfortunately it only goes up to 2017 - I would've liked to have seen the results for 2019 this close to the new year - but nevertheless it's an interesting linguistic glimpse into the zeitgeist of each year.

What words popped up the year *you* were born?
