***tl;dr: This is the 423rd and final (for now) post of igotw.***

I’ve been struggling to find a way to start this post. I’ve come up with a handful of ideas. Each has its own flaws/fallacies and I can’t quite land on one I prefer.

Some ideas were:

I’ve said all I have to say … *(improbable, if not impossible)* I don’t want to do this any more … *(not wholly accurate)* I don’t have time for this … *(callous - somehow “mean”? - and also not strictly true)* Given the current landscape I am restructuring priorities to better align my activities to synergize with business objectives … *(lol corporate* *whargarble)*

In my heart of hearts I’d like this to read like a love letter to readers - particularly those who have followed along for the past 8+ years, who have commented, who have contributed, who have pinged me on Slack with an idea for a post or about some value they got out of the thing. Reality is more like this: I’m tired. In the here-and-now igotw feels like a “chore” more than it ever has, and I need to take a break from it.

…and so. I reserve the right to pick this back up where I left off at some point in the future, but for now? This is it.

Thank you for reading.
