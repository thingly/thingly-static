I had to re-parse the title of [Computer Science Major Arcana](https://www.tumblr.com/eyepool/722652304002678784/computer-science-major-arcana) after reading the first sentence ("Ohhhhh! Its a 'Major Arcana based on Computer Science', not 'an Arcana, for Computer Science Majors'.") I *also* [had to look up what Major Arcana meant. Having done so, it bugs me a bit that NULL isn't 0, and ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana) that 1 corresponds to The Fool...but there are some goodies in there, like:

***Undefined Behavior****: You have transgressed the Law, but were not lucky enough to Crash. The Specification no longer protects you, the rules* *no longer apply, anything whatsoever may now occur. Carry holy Kleenex.*

Heh. I'd kinda like to see one for distributed systems - cards for things like CAP Theorem and eventual consistency. It'd also be kinda rad to see these illustrated...but that's entirely beyond my capabilities. Ah, well.
