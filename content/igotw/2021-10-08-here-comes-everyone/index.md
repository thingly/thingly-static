ICYMI Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp experienced a major outage earlier this week. How major? Welp, they were hard down for something on the order of 6 hours, so...pretty Major.

What did that look like for us? Well, at a high level it would appear that Facebook going down is good for (our) business:

Lookit all those extra queue pee esses!

[If you’re interested, there are also some data scientists off sciencing the data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PsSw8NvImM_ov9Pl-dHp1piXyNsNKze48vy7fsRLF7I/edit) (like they do), teasing out additional interesting little tidbits - things like sessions increase on mobile being roughly 3X the increase we saw on desktop, or a disproportionate amount of this additional traffic going to Messaging (which saw a 62.17% WoW increase!)

Cool stuff. :-)
