I've talked about _Family Night_ before. I thought the night before (US) Thanksgiving might be a good time to swing back around to it.

This is my niece Madigan. She had a school project to present her "favorite family tradition or day of the year"...and what she picked was Family Night.

...and no, I'm not crying, *you're crying*.

Happy Thanksgiving, folks. I'll see y'all on Monday.
