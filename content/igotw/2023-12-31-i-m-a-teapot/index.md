This last post of 2023 is igotw #418, which just so happens to be one of my favorite  [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418)[. (Yes, there's an RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2324#section-2.3.2) and everything.)

Happy New Year, folks. I'll catch you on the flippy-flop.
