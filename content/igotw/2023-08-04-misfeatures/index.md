A feature is just a bug in a tuxedo. - David Henke

As a bit of a thought exercise, I've been kicking around ideas for "bad social media features" - features that I could very well imagine a Product Manager at a social media company coming up with, but that end up not being such a great idea after all. Here are a few of them, in no particular order:

Venmo

**Feature:** Displaying the bank account balance for every person you create a request for money from.

**User Story**: As a payment requester, I want to know how much the person I'm requesting from can afford.

**Future Work**: Appending *your* bank account balance to every payment you make (so they know how much you *could have* afforded. Suckers.)

**Side Note**: Venmo's concept of a social media feed of financial transactions between/among one's connections is kinda nutty.

LinkedIn/Tinder

**Feature**: Automatically sending anyone you've swiped left on in Tinder a connection request.

**User Story**: As a user of Tinder, I may not be attracted to a person, but I may want to do business with that person in the future.

**Future Work**: Also automatically sending anyone you've swiped *right* on a connection request (rolled out in a "Mix Business with Pleasure" marketing campaign).

**Side Note**: I almost didn't post this one. It's 100% meant as a joke...but the sad fact is that there are people out there who attempt to leverage LinkedIn as a "dating platform". It's a real problem, it's completely fucking icky, and it's utterly un-funny.

Facebook

**Feature**: By default, hide all comments on your feed posts  *except* for the ones coming from Your Aunt. (You know the one...)

**User Story**: As an Aunt who is learning to navigate Facebook, I want my niece/nephew to know exactly where I stand on things - whether that be socially, politically, religiously, or anything having to do with what Aunt Wanda has to say about the matter.

**Future Work**: Why not your Uncle, too?

**Side Note**: Any connection between the feed post and any Aunt or Uncle Comment (AC/UC, respectively) is purely coincidental.

SnapChat

**Feature**: Occasionally re-surfacing an ephemeral Snap at random from N months ago (we'll tune N through A/B testing over various demographics).

**User Stories**: As a sender of Snaps I'd like the opportunity to develop character and/or humility. As a receiver of Snaps...well...I might-could wanna see that one again.

**Future Work**: Pivot, and make *all* previously-ephemeral messages persistently available.

**Side Note**: The amount of trust that people have in some online platforms is astounding.

FourSquare

**Feature**: When you check into a bar, the app will periodically post updates about your tab until you've left.

**User Story**: As a user, I want all my friends to know how much fun I'm having tonight!

**Future Work**: Monthly roll-ups of how much total money you've spent at establishments you are the "Mayor" of.

**Side Note**: Does anyone reading this actually remember FourSquare? Mebbe I'm dating myself a bit here?

TikTok

Full Stop.
