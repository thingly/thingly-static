By now I reckon most of y'all have seen the shipping memes floating around the interwebitubes - "It's in God's hands now" and suchlike. Welp. I'm here to tell ya, the memes are real.

About a month ago my wife ordered us a few books from a [local bookstore](https://www.bookloft.com/). Amazon could've had 'em to us in a coupla days, but we like to buy local when we can (especially if it's supporting something as rad as a bookstore). A week later they hadn't shipped yet - no big deal, we're in no rush. Two weeks later they were at our local USPS distribution center - coolness, I should have my hands on [Ready Player 2 any day now! A week after that? Flint, Michigan. ](https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-Two-Ernest-Cline/dp/1524761338) Um...something has gone awry here. Current status: our books - shipped from a bookstore 5, *maybe* 6 miles down the road from us - are somewhere outside of Pittsburgh. I've moved beyond irritation into bemusement. I mean...where will this adventure take us next?

In a completely coincidental bit of marital tit-for-tat, I ordered my wife a sweater from an Etsy seller in Warsaw, Poland. The sweater has shipped...but when it crossed the border into Ukraine all the tracking information switched to Cyrillic, so I couldn't actually tell you what the status of the thing is. The game is afoot - it's a race! Let's see which one gets here first!

haha Good times, good times.
