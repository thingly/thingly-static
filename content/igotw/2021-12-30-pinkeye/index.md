For Christmas this year I got…pinkeye! Hooray for me.

Before you proceed with reading this post, go ahead and take a little time to make your jokes about how I got pinkeye. Victim-blame away, seriously. I’m pretty sure I’ve heard them all by now. The jokes are all funny and I can appreciate that brand of humor. Don’t worry, I’ll wait. It’s okay. Really.

Coincidentally I had an appointment with my optometrist scheduled for 12/29 so I suppose things kind of worked out (insofar as having pinkeye can “work out”), but there were a couple of aspects of the whole experience that I thought might be interesting to talk about.

First off: Doc diagnosed the pinkeye as being viral. He also mentioned that if I’d gone to Urgent Care or a family doctor they probably would’ve mis- diagnosed it as bacterial and prescribed a (completely ineffective) antibiotic. Non-optometrists simply don’t have the equipment/expertise to tell the difference, and the majority of the time it’s bacterial…so that’s how they handle it.

Huh.

Okay. I guess I’m glad I didn’t waste my time (and co-pay) on that.

Also of interest: the instructions on the prescribed eye drops are “two drops, four times a day, for seven days”. Doc told me that wasn’t (quite) right. Here’s the skinny: you only actually need *one* drop. Anything more than that one drop ends up just running down your cheek.

…but also, that one drop has to actually make it *into your eye*…and a lot of folks aren’t all that good at getting eye drops into their actual-ass eyes. So the instructions have to account for the fact that the number of drops that leave the bottle doesn’t necessarily have a direct correlation with the number of drops that end up in eyeballs.

Before yesterday I’m not sure what concepts of Resilience I would’ve expected to be baked into the field of optometry…but now I know.

Anyhow, I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas.

Happy New Year! I’ll catch you on the flip-side.
