I've been watching a handful of talks from last month's [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com/) conference. One that piqued my interest in particular was Andrew Black's "[Why ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqYCt9rTG8g) [Programming Languages Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqYCt9rTG8g)". His central thesis is that the programming languages you know are a major influence on the way that you think as a [programmer - a weak form of linguistic relativity, applied to programming. I've experienced this firsthand; the way I might think about solving a problem in C ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) [is almost certainly going to differ from how I would think about solving it in Python. In a subsequent talk, Douglas Creager calls out that one of the ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umSuLpjFUf8) outcomes of this thesis is that learning new languages makes you a *better* programmer. I think this is likely to be true.

So. Having been thus convinced, and wanting to become a better programmer, I decided it was time I (finally!) look into [Rust.](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Learning Rust has been on my mental backlog of ToDos for a while now - after all, if [Bryan Cantrill](https://thenewstack.io/bryan-cantrill-on-rust-and-the-future-of-low-latency-systems/) likes it then it must be worth checking out - I've just never dug in. To this end I've been spending 30-40 minutes a day plowing through the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises. Once I'm through with that I'll probably spin up a project that's a little "meatier"/more realistic than "Hello, world!" I haven't *quite* gotten to the point where I'd say I can "think in Rust." In fact, for the most part I've been leveraging my knowledge of C to help inform my mental model of Rust - "Oh, so everything is a const unless you explicitly say it's mutable", for example. I'd imagine that if I *didn't* already know C I'd be having a much harder time - "C'mon, guys, why do you have two different 'kinds' of string?"

Anyhow...it's a work in progress.
