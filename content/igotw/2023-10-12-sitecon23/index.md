_LinkedIn's eighth annual SiteCon_ (formerly, _SRE[in]con__) was last week, and the recordings and _[slides](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cblood_linkedin_biz/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fcblood%5Flinkedin%5Fbiz%2FDocuments%2FSiteCon%2FSiteCon%202023%2FSiteCon%202023%20Slides&ga=1&LOF=1) are now available. For those interested in the history _of the conference, Carolyn Blood put together a great talk on _[The Evolution of SiteCon](https://linkedin.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5616e49d-3153-4b5b-88c9-b0970170b161). From relatively humble beginnings in 2016, the conference has grown from a one-day offsite with 17 talks and 175 attendees to a 3-day fully-virtual event featuring 55 talks and 6 workshops for ~1300 attendees. (Side note: When the conference re-branded to "SiteCon" in 2021 I advocated for calling it "BrunoCon" - "Leave the gun, take the Con[nelly]." It didn't get much traction.)

Anyhow, for those who were unable to attend or had to make a hard choice between multiple talks in the same time slot, here's your chance to catch up!
