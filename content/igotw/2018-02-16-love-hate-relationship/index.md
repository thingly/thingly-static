I've spent a little time thinking about this inGraph that _Loren Carvalho shot my way (thanks, lo-lho!)_

Play around with it a bit.)

Anyhow...there are things I love about this inGraph and things I hate about it.

What do I love? For one: it's named ***classified***. Whoa. I'm not sure whether I have sufficient security clearance to even be looking at this inGraph. *I could* *tell you what this is, but then I'd have to kill you.* I also love that it represents legacy range being turned off; sweeping tech debt off the front porch is always awesome. It also has a certain aesthetic...which is to say: it looks super-rad.

What don't I love? Well...it's named ***classified***. Not super-descriptive. *I could tell you what this means, but then I'd have to kill you.* Also, stacked graphs like this can be really difficult to interpret. There was a Big Purple that kinda smooshed down and had its area replaced by some additional Big Blue, and then some of the New Yellow and New (but Slightly-Different) Purple...aww, fuck it, who knows what's going on. (This is why I linked to it - a lot of this is mitigated by being able to hover over the graph and see the values as you slide back and forth).

At any rate it's a great inGraph. Thanks for passing it along, lo-lho, and kudos to you and all the folks involved in shutting down legacy range!
