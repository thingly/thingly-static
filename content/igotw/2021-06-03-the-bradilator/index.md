An old friend and former colleague from a previous life is stopping by tonight. Brady likes drinking beer on front porches, I have beer and a front porch...the thing was basically Meant to Be. I haven't seen Brady in probably 10-15 years - he's spent the past decade or so of his semi-retirement wandering the Earth like Kane from Kung Fu - so when he let me know he was going to be in town it triggered some old memories.

Perhaps my favorite memory is when someone from our old team (I don't *think* it was me?) verbified his name. To wit:

***bradilate*** *(verb) - |BRAY-duh-late| - to close Jira tickets as quickly as is humanly possible*

***NB:*** *The act of bradilation has precisely* zero *bearing on whether or not any actual work got done. Efficient ticket closure is the sole necessary and* *sufficient condition.*

This term is useful for anyone who has to deal with Jira on the daily, and has enormous potential applicability in the tech industry.

Putting some long-overdue backlog grooming on the calendar? Why not call it what it is: a 30-minute bradilation sesh.

Feeling a little overwhelmed because you bit off a bit more than you could chew this sprint? A few minutes spent bradilating might calm your nerves.

Automation went haywire and accidentally generated hundreds of unwanted tickets? Man...wouldn't it be great if there was a "Bradilate" button?
