Earlier this week Someone in Some Channel Somewhere mentioned having a (bad) habit of iterating on product features based on how the software has already been designed/built, as opposed to developing what the customer needs. In a bit of [Baader-Meinhof, not 2 weeks ago I was describing this ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader%E2%80%93Meinhof_effect) phenomenon to a buddy of mine (who is not in tech) using the analogy of refrigerator design. I've captured it here for your amusement:

**Product:** Refrigerator is great! We also need it to be able to freeze things.

**Engineer:** We built Refrigerator to only support temperatures as low as 37 degrees Farenheit. It won't freeze things.

**Product:** Yep, I know - I was there when we first launched Refrigerator - but the feedback we're getting is that folks really need to freeze things, too.

**Engineer:** But if it went below 37 degrees then people might end up with things being frozen that they didn't want frozen.

**Product:** Ah, good point. Then maybe we have two different compartments - one that refrigerates and one that freezes.

**Engineer:** That sounds like it'd be expensive to implement and I don't think anyone will want it.

**Product:** Well, 75% of our users bought ice cream this week, so let's talk about what it might cost to implement Freezer.

**Engineer:** Hang on, hang on...didn't we implement a "No Ice Cream" policy a while back?

**Product:** <sigh> Yes, we did, because the thing we built wouldn't support keeping ice cream frozen and we didn't want customer complaints about melted ice cream...

Anyhow, he got the point.

Happy Thursday, folks! :-)
