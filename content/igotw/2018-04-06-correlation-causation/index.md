I stumbled across this pair of graphs showing a pretty tight correlation between progress on the GDPR Online Deletions horizontal initiative and Dow Jones _performance (IIRC thanks go to Xin Cai_ for throwing this one together).

As the graph title indicates, this lil guy compares DNS queries for linkedin.com against LNKD closing prices. ...pretty decent leading indicator, no?

*[Disclaimer: The author of igotw does not recommend making investment decisions based upon either of these graphs.]*
