I've known for a long time that they existed, but I didn't know that [Single-serving sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serving_site) (SSSes) were a "named thing" until just recently. Let's take a look at a few of my faves, shall we?

[http://www.hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/ might be the first SSS I can recall seeing. If you're not big on science news: ](http://www.hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/) when the Large Hadron Collider first came online, there was a big to-do about it potentially causing a black hole that would swallow up All of Everything We Know. Click through to see whether that's happened yet. [https://isitwednesday.vercel.app/ features a bitchin' lil froggo whose sole purpose is to let you know whether or not it's Wednesday. This is ](https://isitwednesday.vercel.app/) legitimately useful. [https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/) gives the names and nationalities of everyone who is in space at this very moment, as well as how long they've been "up there". Very cool. [https://www.dialupsound.com/](https://www.dialupsound.com/) is for those who are nostalgic for the days of dial-up modems. (Fair warning: you might want to turn your sound down a bit for this one.)

...and then we've got one that isn't *quite* single-serving...but it's close, and it ticks boxes for me in terms of fondness of maps and data-viz: [https://mcbroken.](https://mcbroken.com/) [com/](https://mcbroken.com/). This one maps out the question "Is the McDonald's ice cream machine broken?" for any given location. I'm lovin' it.

Dream Big, folks - some day you too could be the proprietor of a fine single-serving site.
