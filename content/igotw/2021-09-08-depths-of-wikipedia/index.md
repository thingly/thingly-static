For a long time I struggled trying to figure out exactly what Instagram was. I mean, sure, pictures of stuff...but like...what is it *for*? Does it “fit” into my life? ... how?

...and then, I came across [Depths of Wikipedia.](https://www.instagram.com/depthsofwikipedia/)

As someone who frequently falls down the [wikihole, this is an Insta of Greatness. From the ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole)[hilarious to the ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDZNQTlhUp/)[bizarre to the ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTi-b69sW6a/)[downright fascinating...it’s all ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSTQGqyMfma/) there.

So far as I’m concerned, *this* is what Instagram is for.

(Oh, and also probably pictures of peoples’ kids.)
