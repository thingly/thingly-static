Yes, this is a PNG screenshot of the original - it would appear that Confluence doesn't support SVG as an image type. Neat.

Anyhow...nearly 90% of the traffic from these browsers is either the latest or the -1 version, with a precipitous falloff after that. As an engineer - decidedly not a UX engineer, but one who groks deeply the pain of having to support older/legacy versions of things generally - this makes me happy.

Happy Father's Day, folks, and Happy Juneteenth!
