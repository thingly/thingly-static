I haven't done a UA post in a little while so I've got a handful of interesting inGraphs for you today. First up, a little something _Mark Feinstein_ sent my way:

This one's fairly straightforward: a "manual" redline test in which we shut down a couple of nodes at a time to see how the remaining nodes performed - in this particular case, wrt how many open file descriptors each one held. Oh, and it looks kinda like a caterpillar.

And finally, this little gem:

...because phasers, pew pew!
