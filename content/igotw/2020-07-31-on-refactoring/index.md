My wife (Kate) bought a new piece of furniture - just a bit of flat pack kit for additional storage in the living room. After we got the kids to bed I threw in my earbuds and went about knocking it together. Straightforward set of instructions, I know my way around a screwdriver...this should just take an hour or so, right?

Then the subject of placement came into play:

*If we put the new-new in this corner, then that means we’ll have to move the end table to accommodate the doors...*

*<fast-forward>*

*...and if the recliner goes over here, then we have to shift the pictures from that spot on the wall…*

*<fast-forward>*

*...and this cabinet is just a little too high for the HDMI cable to reach comfortably, so what if we…*

*<fast-forward>*

*...and that might* ultimately *mean that we need to get rid of the coffee table, but in the meantime what would it look like if we moved the sofa over* *to…*

*<fast-forward>*

...and now it’s 3:30 in the morning. There’s dust everywhere, a gnarled pile of charging cables and other discovered detritus in the recliner. Kate isn’t entirely sure she’s happy with ***any*** of our Life Decisions thus far...but maybe - just maybe - it’s time to go to bed.
