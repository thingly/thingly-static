I had a conversation at Sports Page a while back with one of the SWEs I supported and a new hire that he’d he’d taken under his wing.

*Old Hand to FNG*  “This is Cliff. He’s an SRE. SREs are the Most Powerful!”*:*

*FNG (eyes wide as saucers)*  “Ohhhhhhhh!”*:*

It was kind of funny at the time - a little embarrassing, and admittedly a little flattering. I’ve thought about it quite a bit since then - about this idea that Engineers in general (and SREs, in particular) are some kind of techno-wizards with Special Powers. The more I think about it the more I think it’s actually pretty harmful. I’ll get to that in a minute. First, let’s explore some of the possible origins of this perception:

[**SREs have a very particular set of skills.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzsitQ76bYQ&t=14) I won’t deny that I have had the opportunity to work alongside some intimidatingly-talented engineers. Even after 6+ years at LinkedIn I’m sometimes still blown away that I can call these folks my peers. **SREs have root.** There are, in fact, some things SREs can do that other folks cannot. SREs tend to be given “the keys to the kingdom” - sudo /root access, lix approval permissions, etc. Despite this distinction being policy-based and not capability-/talent-based, I feel like it’s a contributing factor. **SREs have beards.** This one is obviously tongue-in-cheek - I am an SRE and I do not have a beard - but anecdotally I’d say SREs have a higher likelihood of being bearded than, say, accountants...and a much higher likelihood of having a wizard-like beard. Appearances can be deceiving, but...well...if you walk into a room looking like Gandalf people are going to form a certain kind of opinion.

Okay...so what’s the big deal? I myself admitted to feeling flattered, what’s wrong with a little flattery? Why might this be a bad thing?

[**Magnification of impostor syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)**.**[ Impostor syndrome already runs rampant in the tech industry](https://www.cnet.com/news/tech-employees-likely-to-suffer-from-impostor-syndrome/). Elevating engineering roles to god-like status can enhance the effects of feeling “like a hack”. **Learned helplessness.** Having the perception that SREs are the only ones who can perform a particular class of tasks (deployments, for example) actually runs directly counter to a core part of the SRE mission - specifically, empowering engineers to make changes to the site as efficiently (and safely!) as possible. “I didn’t know/nobody told me I could do that” is one thing, but in the worst case this is effectively a regression to the Bad Old Days of silos and specialized roles; Developers wrote the code, “Ops” was expected to run it, and ne’er the twain shall meet. Ugh. **Actively inhibits diversity.** This is the single worst effect of the perception of engineer-as-superhuman. “Meritocracy” be damned - if you elevate a particular role to a position of higher status then you will end up with a system in which “people *like them* are capable of things *like that*”, and by extension “I am ***not*** *like them*, and therefore I am ***not*** capable.”

I have a friend who I *know* would make an excellent SRE. She has even gone so far as hinting at wanting to become one “...but I don’t have a Computer Science degree.” Even ignoring the fact that I know plenty of SREs who don’t have degrees in CS - or who don’t have a college degree at all, or who *gasp* have a Liberal Arts degree! - I feel a certain subtext here. This isn’t about “I haven’t had the proper training”; it’s about “*I am not smart/good/talented* *enough.*”

Fuck that.

Look, I’ve seen dudes do things with awk that took my breath away. And that’s awesome! That said, a hiring process that selected exclusively for being proficient in awk would be awful. (If you’re not convinced that awk-focused hiring would be awful then we need to talk - please, reach out, and we’ll find you some help.) Taking it a step further, if there were a perception that “only people who grok awk need apply” that would be even worse. Extending this to the worst possible case: a perception that “there is a certain class of person - the Awk-Grokker - and *I am not in that class* ”.

The above might be a bit silly as dystopian analogies go, but I suspect it’s not far off the mark in some ways. Anyhow, if you take nothing else away from this post I hope it is the following: that engineers - SREs - are people. Not some “special class”, but *people*.
