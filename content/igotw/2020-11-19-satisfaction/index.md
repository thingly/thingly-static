For the better part of 20 years I’ve built my own PCs. Once every few years I get tired of the machine I’m using - maybe it’s perceivably “slow”, maybe [som](/igotw/2019-05-31-infrastructure/) [ething broke, maybe there’s some New Hotness out that I want to be able to try - and I start looking around at components to start a new build. My current ](/igotw/2019-05-31-infrastructure/) machine is approaching the age when I’d typically start doing this...but…

Well, my PC needs have changed over time. I don’t do a ton of gaming any more, I don’t strictly “need” the latest-and-greatest from a performance standpoint. Also, the machine that I have was built with considerable experience around what I want in a computer. First and foremost: it’s quiet - damn near silent, even under load. It’s small - about as small a form-factor as you can get and still accommodate a full-size video card. It’s fast enough to do everything I want, has enough RAM to do everything I want, has a nice big SSD with plenty of storage for everything I want. In short: I can’t think of any change that I might make to it that would result in any noticeable improvement.

Total fuckin’ bummer.

Some of this has to do with yearning for the “new shiny”. I can admit to that. A buddy of mine just got a PS5 and I had to cop to a bit of PS Envy. ...but I reckon more broadly that the “journey” was kinda the point, and now that I’ve arrived at the “destination” the thing has effectively become an appliance.

Appliances are boring. One doesn’t tinker with the toaster.

Ah, well.
