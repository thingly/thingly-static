### In the Beginning...

A short time ago[^1] in a galaxy not so far away[^2] I maintained a company-internal blog at a former employer. I posted once a week without fail for over 8 years - 420-some-odd posts. It's something I'm still proud of. The name of the blog was **inGraph of the Week** (igotw, for short).

**igotw** started with a directory full of screenshots I'd taken of interesting graphs/telemetry of the systems I was supporting. Before I ever wrote a single post I had hundreds of these images, and I was fond of busting open my stash and telling their stories to anyone within earshot.

> "See this spike in traffic? This is when Conan mentioned our site that one time."

> "Look at these instance error rates. See how the canary broke, got promoted, got rolled back...and then the same exact thing happened the very next week?"

> "Check out this plateau in p95 latency - what do _you_ think the timeout configuration looks like?"

...and so on. My manager at the time saw this and encouraged me to publish these stories more broadly so that more people could get value out of them...and so, igotw was born. I'd like to capture a few things I learned along the way for posterity.

### Writing Is _Hard_

For me, writing isn't something that comes naturally. I'm still bad at it. I tend to try to make my writing sound like my speech, which means an awful lot of over-use of punctuational quirks[^3] [^4]. I have a hard time getting into a "flow" state, and a _really_ hard time not going back over the first few sentences/paragraphs obsessively before finishing a draft. In short: I'm pretty sure I Do It Wrong&trade;. I don't actually have a solution for this, other than to say...

### Writing _Consistently_[^5] Is Hard

Gym rats grok this. If you wanna pump your quadriflexiceps, you gotta have a routine. You have to put in the work, you have to do it regularly, and - for me, at least - you have to never _not_ do it. When I started writing igotw, the deal I made with myself was "Every Thursday". And yes, that meant shipping a post on Thanksgiving Day...but that's what I needed in order to make the thing keep going. Skipping a week because I "wasn't feeling it" would've been a backslide into oblivion. I _will_ note that once I'd been doing it for a few years I established enough trust in myself to relax this constraint to "once a week (so long as it's published by Sunday)". But at the outset? It was Thursday, Period.

### Writing Is _Worth It_

I've mentored a fair number of folks along the course of my career and given more informal advice to a many more. I'd say "Write!" is probably in the top 5 nuggets I'd bestow upon just about anyone[^6]. A (brief) FAQ of the follow-up questions I've gotten on this:

* **What should I write?** Literally, anything[^7].
* **Why should I write?** A manager I had in a previous life once told me "Any investment you make in yourself is a good investment." This was sage advice then and has held up well over time. This isn't just _ars gratia artis_ we're talking about here. Being able to write - to put thoughts to "paper" - to communicate - is a super-valuable skill, and honing a skill takes practice. So...practice it.
* **What if no one reads it?** My first instinct to this question is to respond "Who cares?"...but
* **What if _everyone_ reads it** 

[^1]: We're talking months, at time of writing.
[^2]: In fact, our very own galaxy.
[^3]: ...and entirely too much profanity.
[^4]: ...and too many footnotes.
[^5]: ...or really doing _anything_ consistently...
[^6]: Right up there with "Never get involved in a land war in Asia."
[^7]: Unless you've got a cooking blog...in which case, just post the fucking recipe. Put it at the top and/or have one of those lovely "Jump to Recipe" buttons. I'm sure the time you summered in Tuscany was the absolute tiznits, but I've got mouths to feed and I'm just trying to remember which spice I'm missing in this sauce.
