## Summary { #summary .content-section }
I'm a leader, mentor, tinkerer, and technologist with 2 decades of experience in system administration
and site reliability engineering. I tend to think of the Big Picture in terms of systems and tradeoffs,
but I can go deep when/where I need to. The tech itself is almost always the easy part; it's the
People and Process that are hard.
