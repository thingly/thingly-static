static site content

## Building & Running
The static content for the site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To build the content you'll need to have hugo installed, as well as golang (for modules, such as the theme). Once you have those simply do:

`hugo`

You can run a dev server - including content in draft status - by doing:

`hugo serve -D`
